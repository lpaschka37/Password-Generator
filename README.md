## The Assignment
Title: Password Generator  
Assignment: 3  
Author: Kyle Kleven    
Course: UofM Coding Boot Camp 

### The Purpose
This week’s homework involves completing work on a password generator application that that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### How it Works
* Click the button to generate a password. 
* You will be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. 
* Select which criteria to include in the password. 
* Start by choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
* Next choose character types of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* Input is validated and at least one character must be selected
* When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* The password is then written to the page
